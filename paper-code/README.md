We use IPython Notebooks for producing paper results. The scripts used for different purposes are indexed below:   

1. Certificate corpus analysis*: Tables 1 and 3
2. Graphs/Graph-DiscrepanciesVSCoverage: Figure 2
3. Graphs/Graph-Matrix: Figure 3
4. Graphs/Graph-Temperature: Figure 4
5. Graphs/Graph-CertCountVSDiscrepanvies: Figure 5
6. Zlint for 00000s + Diversity Comparison Zlint: Figure 6 and 5.3.2 analysis
7. Library checkpointing: Figure 7
8. Discrepancy analysis + Library logs analysis : 5.3.1 analysis 

*The outputs for cells of this notebook were cleared for anonymity reasons: we will re-upload this notebook after publication. For other notebooks, the output information should be intact to help avoid re-running code.
